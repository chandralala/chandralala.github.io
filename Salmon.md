# Spring Chinook Salmon and Runoff Risk in Oregon
Salmon are an essential fish with great cultural, economic, and ecological significance to the Pacific Northwest.
They are a migratory fish that rely on rivers throughout the state. Because of this, contamination from runoff
into river streams pose great risks to salmon habitats.

This project was completed to explore runoff risk for the Spring Chinook Salmon river habitats. The risk factors that were considered are landcover and impervious surface cover.

This map shows historical and current Spring Chinook Salmon habitats and contamination risk through runoff from high to low. 
This map was created using the ArcGIS Suitability Modeler tool. Impervious surface cover and landcover were used in the modeling. 
Impervious surface cover and landcover data was retrieved from ArcGIS Living Atlas.
