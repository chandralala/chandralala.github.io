# Salmon and Runoff Risk in Oregon
Salmon are an essential fish with great cultural, economic, and ecological significance to the Pacific Northwest.
Salmon are a migratory species that rely on rivers throughout the state. Because of this, contamination from runoff
into river streams pose great risks to salmon habitatS. This project was completed to gain insight into salmon habitats and their 
risk of contamination through runoff. Risk factors that were considered are landcover and impervious surface cover.

This map shows historical and current salmon habitats and contamination risk through runoff from high to low. 
This map was created using the ArcGIS Suitability Modeler tool. Impervious surface cover and landcover were used in the modeling. 
Impervious surface cover and landcover data was retrieved from ArcGIS Living Atlas.
