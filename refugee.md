# Potential Syrian Refugee Sites
Since the start of the Syrian war more than six million people have become refugees, constituting the world's largest refugee crisis. This project was completed as a class assignment to discover possible Syrian refugee sites. To identify potential refugee sites, the following criteria were considered: distance, area, slope, and landcover. The refugee sites were chosen on the basis that they were within 100km of the Syrian border, at least 100 square km, on a slope of no more than 10%, and contained vegetative cover. In total, there were 11 possible Syrian refugee sites totalling 1134 square km.

This map shows potential refugee sites. This map was created by using buffers and converting raster datasets into binary maps representing acceptable and unacceptable sites. These datasets were merged into one layer to determine acceptable refugee sites. Elevation data was retrieved from SRTM and landcover data was retrieved from Land Cover Climate Change Initiative.
