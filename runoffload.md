# Investigating Land Use and Runoff Load
Watershed pollution has far-reaching negative implications on human and environmental health. It is an especially prevailing concern in urban and agricultural areas that release contaminants. Areas with these types of primary land uses typically have reduced soil health and increased impermeable surfaces, which come together to reduce the land's ability to absorb runoff. Runoff absorption acts as a buffer to watershed pollution, as pollution occurs when runoff water flows and carries contaminants into watersheds. As such, areas with urban and agricultural land uses suffer from higher watershed pollution risk. 
<br>
Hydrologist obtain curve numbers to estimate runoff load in watershed pollution risk assessments. Curve numbers are measurements based off land cover and soil conditions. High curve numbers are associated with large amounts of runoff, while low curve numbers are associated with small amounts of runoff. One way curve numbers can give insight into watershed pollution mechanisms is by indicating whether surrounding lands of a watershed are increasing or absorbing runoff loads.

A Clackamas and Tualatin river watershed were studied to explore the effects of surrounding land on runoff loads and gain more insight into watershed pollution mechanisms. The two study sites in Clackamas and Tualatin are starkly different in their primary land uses:  the Clackamas study area is characterized by forestry and rural land uses, while the Tualatin study area is characterized by agricultural and urbanized land uses. The Clackamas study site is comprised of mostly forested lands and hydrologic soil groups B and C. The Tualatin study site is comprised of mostly developed and agricultural lands, with hydrologic soil groups B, C, and D.

Watershed delineations for each study site were created using varying buffers around pour points to incorporate increasing amounts of proximate land. Assuming drained soil conditions, the average curve number for each watershed was calculated for comparative analysis.

This map shows Clackamas site watershed delineations at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30km buffer distances.

This map shows Tualatin site watershed delineations at 5, 10, 15, 25, and 30km distances.

Plotting average curve number against buffer distance reveals that surrounding lands absorb the runoff load of the Clackamas and Tualatin watersheds, since curve numbers decrease as more land is incorporated into delineation. This indicates that the surrounding lands are not contributing to watershed pollution by increasing overall runoff amounts. The surrounding lands absorb runoff and allow for water infiltration.
