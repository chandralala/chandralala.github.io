## Northern Spotted Owls and Fire Risk
Northern Spotted Owls are a threatened species whose habitat ranges from southwestern British Columbia to northern California. These birds rely on mature confier forests that are subject to fire risk. Northern Spotted Owls have historically adapted to a  mixed-disturbance regime with frequent low-intensity fires and few severe fires. However, fire activity is expected to increase in the coming years and may pose a concern to Northern Spotted Owls who are not adapted to severe fire regimes. If fire activity becomes severe enough to disrupt Northern Spotted Owls, large populations may be lost and habitat connectivity will be decreased.

These maps were created to provide insight into Northern Spotted Owls and the risk that fires may pose to their habitats in Oregon. Approximately 44% of Northern Spotted Owl Sites were found to be in areas of very high or high wildfire hazard potential.

This map shows Northern Spotted Owl sites and their corresponding Wilfire Hazard Potential. This map was created by combining Northern Spotted Owl observation sites and a Wildlife Hazard Potential raster. Observation data was retrieved from BLM. Wildlife Hazard Potential raster data was retrieved from USDA.

This map shows potential Northern Spotted Owl habitats and their corresponding Wildfire Hazard Potential. This map was created by identifying mature confier forests and combining these sites with Wildlife Hazard Potential. Habitat raster data was retrieved from Conservation Biology Institute. Wildlife Hazard Potential raster data was retrieved from USDA.
