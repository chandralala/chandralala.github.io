Welcome to my portfolio! I am a GIS student pursuing my MS at Portland State University. I have a strong environmental background and am interested in conservation, natural resource management, and finding data-driven solutions. I enjoy working on projects that use data sciences to explore, model, or solve environmental issues. 



Here is my [resume](CV.md)!
