# Contamination Risk from Runoff by City in the Portland Metro
Contaminated runoff in cities will inevitably enter streams, rivers, and watersheds, which can harm environmental and human health. 
Knowing which areas are most prone to contamination from runoff can provide insight into how to mitigate the degradation of waterways.


This project was completed as a class assignment. The risk factors considered were land use, impervious land cover, and soil drainage type. The model uses cities as the unit of analysis and assumes that runoff will remain within each city.

This map shows the risk level of contamination from runoff by city in the Portland Metro area from a 1-10 scale. A weighted model was used to create a composite score of the risk factors. Soil data was retrieved from the Gridded National Soil Survey Geographic Database, land use data was retreived from USGS National Land Cover Dataset, and impervious cover data was retrieved from Oregon Metro.
