# Arapahoe County, CO Watershed and Drainage
Visualizing watersheds and drainage paths can provide great insight into city and water planning. This project was created using the ArcGIS Trace Downstream and Create Watershed tools, which are based on a Digital Elevation Model. The map shows storm inlets, watershed boundary, and downstream water drainage paths. It is shown that water in Arapahoe County drains into the South Platte River.

This map shows the simulated watershed and drainage paths in Arapahoe County. Data was clipped to analyze only Arapahoe County storm inlets. Storm inlet data was retrieved from the City and County of Denver Wastewater Management Storm Facility.
