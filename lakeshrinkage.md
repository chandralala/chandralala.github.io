# Lake Shrinking Due to Drought
This map focuses on Lake Powell and Lake Mead, which are two essential reservoirs of the Colorado River Basin responsible for providing water to millions. These reservoirs are suffering from declining water levels, mainly as a result of drought and/or overallocation. Using World Imagery Wayback, satellite imagery of these lakes were taken for comparison between May 2019 and May 2024. Between 2019 and 2024, both lake extents decreased.
