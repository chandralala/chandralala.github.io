# Northern Spotted Owl and Wildfires
Northern Spotted Owls are a threatened species whose habitat ranges from SW British Columbia to northern California. These birds rely on mature confier forests that are subject to fire risk. Northern Spotted Owls have historically adapted to a  mixed-disturbance regime with frequent low-intensity fires and few severe fires. However, fire activity is expected to increase in the coming years and may pose a concern to Northern Spotted Owls who are not adapted to severe fire regimes. These maps were created to provide insight into Northern Spotted Owls and the risk that fires may pose to their habitats. If fire activity becomes severe enough to disrupt Northern Spotted Owls, large populations may be lost and habitat connectivity will be decreased.
