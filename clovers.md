# Clover Suitability in Oregon
Excessive fertilizer use is a major threat to soil health. Nitrogen-fixing clover legumes can supplement nutrients to the soil and act as an alternative to synthetic fertilizers. Methods such as intercropping, cover cropping, crop rotating, mixed cropping, etc., can incorporate legumes and increase soil nutrients while being more sustainable than solely applying synthetic fertilizers. 

This study determines where and how much agricultural soil in Oregon is well-suited for clovers, as well as which species have the largest area of well-suited soil. 10 of the most common clover species found in Oregon were analyzed. It was found that about 39% of Oregonâ€™s agricultural land was well-suited for growing clovers. It was also determined that Crimson, Strawberry, Arrowleaf, Subterranean, Red, and White clovers had the largest area of well-suited soils in the state.

Both map figures were created using soil data from California Resrouce Lab, landcover data from NLCD 2016, and clover requirement data from the OSU Forage Information System.
